ARM-SDK version 1.51

1. File referenceData.txt updated with current values.
	
2. Changes to the ARM XML Schema:

	1. Client_9902_Reporting_Qtr field added to client_profile_databag_5_0.xsd: 
		This new field is currently optional with plans to be required in the future. 
		The field should include the report_period_id reference value for the 9902 reporting quarter 
		that the counseling activity is to be initially reported for. 
	2. Client_Gender changed to optional, additional option of O added. 
		In client_profile_databag_5_0.xsd, the existing Client_Gender field has been changed from 
		required to optional and a third option of “O” for Other has been added as a valid response.
	3. Disallow octal values. 
		The ARM XML schema has been updated to disallow numeric values starting with zeroes, 
		as ARM interprets such values as octal.
	4. Interest rate fields allow for 1 to 3 digits after the decimal. 
		In client_profile_databag_5_0.xsd, the interestRate type has been changed from requiring 
		strictly 3 digits after the decimal place to allowing 1-3 digits after the decimal place.
	5. Remove legacy simple types: 
		The hcsId, outcomeOfVisitId, cmsType, and groupSessionType simple types have been removed 
		as they are no longer being used.
